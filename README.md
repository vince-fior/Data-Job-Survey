# Data_Job_Survey_Dashboard
I utilized Power Query to clean the dataset containing over 600 responses to a survey for data professionals. Then, I created visualizations in Power BI highlighting results such as preferred programming language, average salary, perceived happiness with job position perceived difficulty to break into the industry. A tree map was implemented to filter results by the countries with the most responses.
The repository includes the dashboard pdf, the dataset containing the responses and the MS Power BI file.
