# Data_Job_Survey_Dashboard
I utilized Power Query to clean the dataset containing over 600 responses to a survey for data professionals. Then, I created visualizations in Power BI highlighting data such as preferred programming language, perceived happiness with job position and average salary. A tree map was implemented to filter results by the countries with the most responses.
The repository includes the dashboard pdf, the dataset containing the responses and the Power BI file.
